# Description
The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets you treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

> ℹ️ **Info:**
> In a functional implementation, the pattern is implemented using functions instead of classes.

# Strengths
- The Composite pattern makes it easy to represent and manipulate complex structures of objects.
- It provides a high level of encapsulation.
- It allows you to reuse code and reduce the number of classes you need to create.
- It can make your code more modular and easier to understand.

# Weaknesses
- The Composite pattern can make your code more complex.
- It can be difficult to change the structure of a composite object.

# Considerations
- Use the Composite pattern when you want to represent a part-whole hierarchy of objects.
- The Composite pattern can be used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as the Visitor pattern and the Iterator pattern.
