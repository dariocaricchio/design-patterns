# Description
The Aggregation pattern is a structural design pattern that allows one object to reference another object. The referenced object is not owned by the referencing object.

# Strengths
- Aggregation is a flexible way to compose objects.
- It allows you to reuse code and reduce the number of classes you need to create.
- It can make your code more modular and easier to understand.

# Weaknesses
- Aggregation does not provide the same level of encapsulation as Composition.
- The referenced object can be changed or deleted by other objects.

# Considerations
- Use Aggregation when you want to create a relationship between objects where the referenced object is not owned by the referencing object.
- Avoid using Aggregation when you need to control the lifecycle of the referenced object.
