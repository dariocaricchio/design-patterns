# Description
The Composition pattern is a structural design pattern that allows one object to be composed of other objects. The composed objects are owned by the composite object.

# Strengths
- Composition provides a high level of encapsulation.
- It allows you to reuse code and reduce the number of classes you need to create.
- It can make your code more modular and easier to understand.

# Weaknesses
- Composition can make your code more complex.
- It can be difficult to change the structure of a composite object.

# Considerations
- Use Composition when you want to create a relationship between objects where the composed objects are owned by the composite object.
- Avoid using Composition when you do not need to control the lifecycle of the composed objects.
